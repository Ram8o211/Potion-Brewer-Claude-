// Customer requests: who wants which effects, and why.
//
// Every effect commission starts from one of these situations. A request
// names the effects the customer needs (one to three, chosen to fit one
// coherent purpose — a soldier wants strength and the power to change shape
// for an expedition, never love and poison at once), the kinds of people who
// ask for it, the tier from which it appears, and a few ways of telling the
// story. The generator (commissions.js) then has to find a real way to brew
// it with what the player can buy, gather and equip before the customer is
// allowed to ask.
